this is a collection of the persevere packages all together in a single repository. each package has been added as a submodule. for help with submodules see http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html

clone this repository

    git clone git@github.com:neonstalwart/persvr.git persvr

initialise the submodules

    cd persvr
    git submodule init

update the submodules

    git submodule update

each of the submodules will only be at the commit they were at when i last pushed them.  if you want to get the latest commits, you will need to checkout a branch and pull the new changes into your branch.

feel free to let me know how i can make these instructions better.
